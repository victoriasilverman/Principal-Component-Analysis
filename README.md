# Principal-Component-Analysis
Project with grocery transaction data using PCA
data set used from https://koalaverse.github.io/homlr/data/my_basket.csv

In order to run PCA data must conform to the following;
1. Data are in tidy format per Wickham and others (2014);
2. Any missing values in the data must be removed or imputed;
3. Typically, the data must all be numeric values (e.g., one-hot, label, ordinal encoding
categorical features);
4. Numeric data should be standardized (e.g., centered and scaled) to make features
comparable.

The my_basket data used in this project already fullfills these requirements.
